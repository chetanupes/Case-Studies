Some case studies I did for a job interview 
Case Study : 1
Background
Companies create ads using an online form. In the form, they can apply various tags to their vacancy e.g. positions, subjects, workplaces. We will take an example dataset of a school posting for jobs. Mostly tags are applied well but they can be inconsistent or incorrect (this affects international schools).
Badly tagged ads can fail to attract customers because they are harder for relevant job seekers to find. This can result in a low number of applicants and the vacancy not being filled. We would like you to tackle this problem by building a model that predicts the most appropriate set of tags to apply to vacancies.

Case Study: 2
Background
In construction, projects sometimes do not go as planned because of delay in material procurement, rework etc. This tends to push the project timeline and in turn, each activity associated with it. As a business, we would like you to help us understand our Activity Duration Variance. Can we apply machine learning to our schedule data to understand the features or conditions that are the biggest causes of duration variance in projects?
